Mission to survive  game


Description of the game:
The game is about saving the Earth from non-renewable resourses. It is a tiny figure of the Earth (called Eco Earth) that is trying to save the real earth (since it is its compainion)and there are three levels in order to pass.





Progress until this point:
We discussed the different ideas that we came up with while searching for different energy resourses and we chose to talk about solar energy. Then we diuscussed the ideas we came up with for solar energy and chose to do a game about Eco Earth saving Earth from polutiuon. Then we drew the UI on Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator and chose the most sutable photos for the game. Also, we thought about doing a cutscene at the end of the game and a video at the beginning. Then we tried it out on  Mit App Inventor and started working on the blocks. Finally, we tried and revised everything until we came out with this fascinating and fun game.
